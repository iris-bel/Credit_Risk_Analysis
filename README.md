# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

The aim of this analysis is to compare the performance of six different approaches to predicting credit risk. Using a credit card data set from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, we test the performance of two oversampling methods (RandomOverSampler and SMOTE), one undersampling method (ClusterCentroids), one over- and undersampling method (SMOTEENN), and two machine learning models (BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnemsbleClassifier). The final goal is to make a recommendation as to which model is the most effective at predicting credit card risk, if there is one.
